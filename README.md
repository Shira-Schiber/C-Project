# C-Project
The final project from the course "Systems programming" in the Open University.

The project is to implement an Assembler in C.

The code is in files: assembler.h, assembler.c, data.c, label.c, operation.c,  print.c and valid.c.

prog1.as is an example for an input file and prog1.ent, prog1.ext and prog1.ob are the output files.

prog2.as is another example for an input file and prog2.ent, prog2.ext and prog2.ob are the output files.

invalid_prog.as is an example for an unvalid input file, and in invalid_prog_output.png there is a picture of the output of the program.
